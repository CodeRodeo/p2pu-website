  quote: People come to the United States from many parts of the world. The faces, cultures, customs and religions are all different but the goal is the same- to learn English in order to better their lives. As an immigrant myself I seek opportunities to help families obtain this goal much like my family was helped when we arrived here. Perhaps one day someone I helped will pay it forward and help some one else.
