- question: What is a learning circle?
  answer: Learning circles are free, interest-driven study groups that are led by a facilitator. The facilitator is not an expert in the subject that you are studying, but they are committed to helping you reach your goals and have an enjoyable experience. Without a teacher in the room, learning circles succeed through peer learning, which is based on the belief that everybody has their own expertise and that we learn best by sharing and receiving feedback.
- question: What topics can I learn about?
  answer: Learning circles use free online courses as the basis of study. Some of these courses are created by P2PU, but the vast majority come from online course providers, universities, and non-profit organizations from around the world. Any online course can be used, so long as it is free for participants and not in violation of the terms of service of the course provider. A complete list of courses that have been used in learning circles is available at <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.p2pu.org/courses</a>.
- question: Do learning circles cost money?
  answer: No. Learning circles are free to participate in and free to start.
- question: Do I get any certificate at the end of the learning circle?
  answer: P2PU is not a university and does not offer any accredited degree certificates. Some of the online courses that are used in learning circles provide the option to purchase a certificate, which you can do if you so choose. It is, however, possible to receive a certificate of completion following your learning circle. You should speak to your facilitator if this is of interest to you.
- question: What personal information do I need to provide in order to participate?
  answer: To sign up for a learning circle, you need to share your name and contact information (email address and/or phone number) with your facilitator. You do not need to create a P2PU account in order to sign up for a learning circle. P2PU cares about privacy and does not sell or give any user data away to third parties.
