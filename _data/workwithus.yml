    - subtitle: Research
      description: "<p>We generate a lot of feedback from learners, facilitators, and community organizers, and we are eager to collaborate with researchers who seek to understand how social and peer learning can better support diverse audiences and communities. We’re particularly interested in collaborations that will help us better understand:</p>
        <ul><li>How learning circles support progress towards other educational/professional opportunities</li>
        <li>How learning circles serve as a professional development tool for librarians and other facilitator groups</li>
        <li>The efficacy of learning circles as a model for increasing digital literacy</li>

    - subtitle: Translation
      description: <p>P2PU wants to make its tools available to as many people around the world as possible. If our resources do not already exist in your language, we can offer a template for grant proposals to support the translation of our open-source resources and software. We can work with you to determine whether you will hire the translator directly, or whether we should source someone who can do it.</p>
    - subtitle: Adopt a Feature
      description: "<p>We are constantly learning about how our tools can improve from our community. <a href='https://github.com/p2pu/learning-circles/wiki/Roadmap'>We’ve got a long list of new features we’d like to add</a>, and we’re always looking for people to partner with us as we develop them. If there is a feature you think would help your organization to better run your learning circle program, reach out and we can develop it with you.</p>"
