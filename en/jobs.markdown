## Program Coordinator
####Full time, early 2017 start
Peer 2 Peer University is recruiting a North America-based Program Coordinator to support the growth and development of learning circles: study groups for adults who want to take online courses together in libraries and other public spaces. In the past two years, learning circles have evolved from a pilot project with Chicago Public Library to a movement of educators, librarians, activists, policy-makers, and technologists around the globe -- and in order to keep growing we need you! 

We believe that community-based online learning can challenge the hierarchy and exclusivity of traditional educational institutions and support inclusive, empowering, learning experiences around the world. To achieve this goal, we work with amazing library and civil society partners. Together, we design and build software tools, conduct professional development workshops, develop and curate open educational resources, and advocate for libraries and other community centers as nodes for lifelong learning. 

Your primary responsibilities will be two-fold. First, as program coordinator, you will serve as the main point of contact for the growing P2PU learning circle community by running learning circle training workshops, supporting our virtual community of learning circle organizers, analyzing feedback from participants and facilitators, and coordinating many of our external communications about learning circles. Second, as a member of a small team, you’ll also manage some of our projects, support grant writing and consulting efforts, and serve as a key participant in our open governance structure.

P2PU currently works in Boston, Portland (ME), Providence, Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Charlotte, Cape Town, Nairobi, Nakuru, and Paris. Our office is on the internet, but we value face-to-face time and get together whenever we can. If you believe in the ideals of the organization, communicate well, and are a motivated self-starter, we think that you could do great work with us. 

### Desired skillset

 - Facilitator - you’re great in front of groups, you enjoy organizing people around common values, and you are flexible to the diverse needs of the groups that you are working with. 
 - Catalyst - you love supporting communities, and you think the term “community manager” is an oxymoron.
 - Educator - you have experience as a librarian or teacher, or perhaps you’ve developed curriculum or designed online learning experiences.
 - Communicator - you write clearly and effectively, and are comfortable communicating across multiple mediums including webinars, blogs, and social media.
 - Organizer - you can synthesize complex, diverse information, collect and research data, and summarize your findings articulately both online and offline.
 - Flexible - you are willing to dive into a variety of activities; you are excited to be part of a small, distributed team that requires (mostly US) travel up to 5 days/month.
 - Passionate - you respect both the affordances and limitations of technology to address learning outcomes, and our mission resonates with you.

### To apply

Please send a resume to <thepeople@p2pu.org> with “Program Coordinator” in the subject line. If you have a portfolio (personal website, Github profile, whatever), please link to that as well. Finally, you should include a cover letter that explains why this position interests you and why you are the right person for the job.
