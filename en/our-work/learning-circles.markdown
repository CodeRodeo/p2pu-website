##LEARNING CIRCLES

There is an increasing volume of free, high-quality learning material online, allowing you to learn anything, at any time, anywhere. Sounds amazing, right? Well it is, in theory, but in reality this format can isolate many learners. Actually making it through one of these courses requires an immense amount of self-motivation and discipline, and frankly, not everyone is lucky enough to have the chance to develop these skills. Completion rates for online learning remain under 5%, and learning materials are often inaccessible to individuals who are not computer savvy.

This is where Learning Circles come in. Peer 2 Peer University is developing an offline model for learners who wish to work through free online learning material, together in physical spaces like libraries. At the heart of this study group model is the belief that learning is better together. By convening a group of learners who are all interested in learning similar things, you’ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning environment that has the the potential to be the support system many learners need. Furthermore, peer learning offers learners of all stripes and sizes the opportunity to be exposed to new perspectives, develop useful social skills, and achieve something greater than they could have on their own.

##WHAT WE’VE DONE

In May and June in 2015, we ran four courses across two library branches in the Chicago Public Library system. 
Courses ran for 5-7 weeks, and the groups met once a week in the library branch. The courses were facilitated by a community manager, and participants were recruited from within the library’s community of patrons.  These learners were guided through courses on Python programming, academic writing, GED math preparation and public speaking, all using course materials which are freely available online. We found that the Learning Circle structure not only helped learners feel confident about taking an online course, but our retention rates were also higher than in most online learning courses. And perhaps most importantly, the learners reported feeling more connected to each other, their community and the library branch. 

We also ran another Learning Circle in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In this course, a group of young women (a community traditionally underserved by tech education) worked through the same Python course as those in Chicago. They too reported feeling more confident with the subject matter, and more engaged with the course. One participant even managed to find a job based on the skills she learnt in the course. 

We'll be running more Learning Circles in conjunction with Chicago Public Library in September and October of 2015.

##FUTURE PLANS

We will kick off again in Chicago in September, with about 10 Chicago Public Libraries hosting Learning Circles. [Check out our Chicago site](http://chicago.p2pu.org){:target="_blank"} to sign up for a Learning Circle or get involved in some other way. We plan on adding additional Learning Circles in topics such as finance, HTML/CSS and applying for jobs. Our long-term goal is for any physical infrastructure (library, museum, prison, embassy, etc.)  to be able to plug into the Learning Circle model and empower their respective communities to take charge of their own learning.

##RESOURCES FROM CPL PILOT

Here are some of the resources we developed during the pilot in Chicago. We are working to expand both documentation and software tools for the fall, so that interested library branches can easily introduce Learning Circles to their communities.
