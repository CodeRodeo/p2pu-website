##LEARNING CIRCLES

There is an increasing volume of free, high-quality learning material online, allowing you to learn anything, at any time, anywhere. Sounds amazing, right? Well it is, in theory, but in reality this format can isolate many learners. Actually making it through one of these courses requires an immense amount of self-motivation and discipline, and frankly, not everyone is lucky enough to have the chance to develop these skills. Completion rates for online learning remain under 5%, and learning materials are often inaccessible to individuals who are not computer savvy.

This is where Learning Circles come in. Peer 2 Peer University is developing an offline model for learners who wish to work through free online learning material, together in physical spaces like libraries. At the heart of this study group model is the belief that learning is better together. By convening a group of learners who are all interested in learning similar things, you’ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning environment that has the the potential to be the support system many learners need. Furthermore, peer learning offers learners of all stripes and sizes the opportunity to be exposed to new perspectives, develop useful social skills, and achieve something greater than they could have on their own.

##WHAT WE’VE DONE

[We ran pilot in Chicago. [Bekka to do copy]. check out our chicago page

##FUTURE PLANS

We will kick off again in Chicago in September, with about 10 Chicago Public Libraries hosting Learning Circles. Check out our Chicago site to sign up for a Learning Circle or get involved in some other way. We plan on adding additional Learning Circles in topics such as finance, HTML/CSS and applying for jobs. Additionally, we are in the preliminary stages of expanding Learning Circles to other cities and want to <a href=”sign up form link”>hear from you</a> if you have interest in facilitating or hosting a Learning Circle. Our goal is for any physical infrastructure (library, museum, prison, embassy, etc.)  to be able to plug into the Learning Circle model and empower their respective communities to take charge of their own learning pathways.

##RESOURCES FROM CPL PILOT

Here are some of the resources we developed during the pilot in Chicago. We are working to expand both documentation and software tools for the fall, so that interested library branches can easily introduce Learning Circle to their communities.
