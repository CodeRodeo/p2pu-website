#What are they?

At the heart of this study group model is the belief that learning is better together. There’s a wealth of high-quality, free, online courses out there. And with them, you can learn anything, at any time, anywhere. Sounds amazing, right? Well it is, in theory, but in reality this format can isolate many learners. Actually making it through one of these courses requires an immense amount of self-motivation and discipline, and frankly, not everyone is lucky enough to have the chance to develop these skills.

That’s where study groups come in. By convening a group of learners who are all interested in learning similar things, you’ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning environment that has the the potential to be the support system many learners need.

But wait, there’s more! Peer learning offers learners of all stripes and sizes the opportunity to be exposed to new perspectives, develop useful social skills, and achieve something greater than they could have on their own.

Sadly, this kind of culture cannot be bought, mandated, or otherwise simply turned on. It has to emerge from the community. “Any culture – good or bad – is the result of many small and consistent actions and interactions between many people. Everybody can benefit, and everybody can contribute. It’s your job to help community members understand that everyone shares that responsibility for culture.” [1]

You don’t need to be an expert to facilitate a group. In fact, it’s better that you aren’t. And it’s perfectly reasonable for you to be taking the course for the first time while you facilitate.
