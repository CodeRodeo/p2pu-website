We believe that anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an urban library system, we’re developing a guide to help you on your journey. Check back here on January 31, 2016 to see the final guide.

Additionally, P2PU can consult individuals and organizations looking to get started with Learning Circles. Our services include facilitator training workshops, course selection and adaption expertise, ongoing facilitator support, web hosting, and software tool integration. We are happy to have a 15 minute call with you to talk about strategy and answer any questions you might have - email thepeople@p2pu.org to get that set up.

While you’re waiting for the guide:

 - [Check out the results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19rBHbbRFLrfbJErBMyBii-Q9FOQ5-xXjXVLQxF4fCFY/edit) of our pilot with 11 branches of Chicago Public Library.
 - [Read a blog post](http://info.p2pu.org/2015/12/09/we-became-friends-why-face-to-face-learning-matters/) about about why face to face learning matters.
 - Peruse the U.S. Department of Education’s recent [National Education Technology Plan](http://tech.ed.gov/netp/). P2PU (page 12) is the only project included that is geared towards adult learners!
