    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners 
    who want to take freely available online courses together, in-person. We
     believe that anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to 
    run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an 
    urban library system, this guide is here to help you get going.</p> 
    <p>The first part - <span class="bold">Background</span> - provides 
    introductory information about Learning Circles and the type of learning
     that the format aims to develop. The second part - <span class="bold">Getting Started</span> - includes the steps you need to check off before beginning. The third part - <span class="bold">Running a Learning Circle</span> - introduces facilitation tips and the guidelines for the routine you’ll develop each week. The final part - <span class="bold">Appendix</span> - includes additional tools and templates to make your Learning Circle as good as it can be.</p>

    <h4 class="green space-top">A few things before we get started</h4>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Use our tools</span>. You can run a Learning 
    Circle with just this guide and an online course, but our open source 
    facilitator dashboard will help you promote your Learning Circle, manage
     sign ups, communicate with learners, and share feedback on a weekly 
    basis. Throughout this guide, you’ll see teal highlights where the 
    software can support your Learning Circle. To get your own facilitator 
    dashboard, you just need to sign up at <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/" target="_blank">p2pu.org/facilitate</a>. It’s free for everyone.</p>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Let us help</span>. P2PU can consult 
    individuals and organizations looking to get started with Learning 
    Circles. Our services include facilitator training workshops, course 
    selection and adaption expertise, ongoing facilitator support, web 
    hosting, and software tool integration. We are happy to have a 15 minute
     call with you to talk about strategy and answer any questions you might
     have - email <a href="mailto:thepeople%40p2pu.org?subject=Learning%20Circles">thepeople@p2pu.org</a> to get that set up.</p>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Share your stories</span>. We rely on input 
    and participation from the community, and your feedback will make 
    Learning Circles even better going forward. Head over to <a href="http://community.p2pu.org/">community.p2pu.org</a> to share feedback, photos, suggestions, and questions with facilitators from around the world.</p>

    <p class="space-top">This handbook was developed by <span class="bold">Peer 2 Peer University</span> and <span class="bold">Chicago Public Library</span>, with support from the <span class="bold">Knight Foundation News Challenge</span>
     and a great deal of help from Anna Häggman and Katherine McConachie. We
     are grateful to everyone who contributed to the underlying thinking and
     structure of Learning Circles, especially the librarians and patrons in
     Chicago who pioneered this work with us in 2015.</p>


    <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
    <p>For decades, online learning has offered the potential to deliver 
    cheap, flexible education to a large audience. As the field of online 
    growing has increased rapidly in the past few years, many advocates have
     claimed that online learning will democratize higher education and even
     make universities obsolete.</p> 
    <p>However, there are several barriers that have prevented such a 
    democratization from occurring. In order to succeed in learning online, 
    individuals must already be web savvy, self-directed learners with a 
    great deal of intrinsic motivation and discipline. Given this, it is not
     a surprise that the vast majority of those who complete online courses 
    already have a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
    <p>It is these two phenomena – the volume of high quality online 
    learning resources and the mounting evidence that they have not leveled 
    the educational playing field – that inspired Learning Circles. In early
     2015, P2PU and Chicago Public Library started working together to 
    deliver online courses in a supportive and engaging library environment 
    across Chicago. Specifically targeting adult learners who do not yet 
    have an undergraduate degree, Learning Circles were designed to equip 
    learners with confidence and motivation, springboarding them into future
     educational and professional endeavors.</p>

    <h2>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h2>
    <p>For decades, the web has allowed teachers and institutions to publish
     course materials online. While some institutions and individuals 
    pioneered online learning with low-cost degree programs, others began to
     publish stand-alone course materials online for free. By the early 
    2000s, many freely-available online learning materials became unified 
    under a banner known as Open Educational Resources (OER), broadly 
    defined as “teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in 
    the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property 
    license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others”.</p>
    <p>Around 2008, individuals and institutions starting “running” free 
    online courses synchronously, where learners from around the world could
     sign up and work through course materials together. These experiments 
    were coined as MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses.</p>

    <h2>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)</h2>
    <p>It didn’t take long for MOOCs to catch on. Initially they were run by
     individual instructors at different institutions, but soon large 
    universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Stanford started designing their 
    own MOOC platforms and partnering with universities around the world to 
    transform courses into MOOCs and publish them online for anyone to use.</p> 
    <p>Some MOOCs are digital versions of existing courses, where professors
     deliver their lectures via video and upload readings to a website. 
    Others take advantage of the online medium, and create new learning 
    experiences for online learners. One thing most MOOCs share is that they
     require learners to be self-directed and motivated, and to be 
    comfortable working online. Because of this, the vast majority of 
    participants drop out of MOOCs without finishing.</p> 
    <p>Learning Circles position MOOCs in a social space. Emphasizing <span class="bold">peer learning</span> and <span class="bold">academic mindset</span>
     growth, a diverse group of learners can now benefit from online 
    learning as they develop cognitive skills, explore new learning 
    strategies, and improve their digital literacy in a social space.</p>

    <h2>Peer learning</h2>
    <p class="list-below">There are three values that underlie P2PU’s concept of peer learning:</p>  
    <ul>
    <li>Everybody’s an expert in something</li>
    <li>Sharing is how we learn best</li>
    <li>Feedback is necessary in order to improve </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By convening a group of learners who are interested in a similar 
    topic, you’ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning 
    environment that has the the potential to be the support system many 
    learners need. Peer learning can create a rich learning environment in 
    which everyone simultaneously teaches and learns, acts and observes, 
    speaks and listens. This exposes learners of all stripes and sizes to 
    new perspectives, provides an opportunity to develop useful social 
    skills, and allows individuals to achieve something greater than they 
    could have on their own.</p>

    <h2>Academic mindsets</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Academic mindsets is a term used to describe the 
    beliefs that learners have about themselves, their intelligence, and 
    their abilities. These mindsets influence a learner’s motivation and 
    perseverance, which in turn influences their study habits and overall 
    academic performance. A positive academic mindset is described in four 
    statements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“I belong to this community”</li>
    <li>“My ability and competence grow with my effort”</li>
    <li>“I can succeed at this”</li>
    <li>“This work has value for me”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learning Circles support academic mindsets by combining group 
    activities with course content. These activities will help learners 
    develop a learning community, set and achieve attainable goals, develop 
    new learning strategies, connect the work to their goals, and reflect 
    and improve upon the Learning Circle model. Many learners have told us 
    that the development of these skills is equally or even more powerful 
    than learning new content from the online material.</p>
