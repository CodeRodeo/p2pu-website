description: We believe people learn better together. We envision a global network of grassroots learning communities—powered by freely-shared knowledge and people-first organizations—where personal growth and collective transformation is freed from institutional walls. We champion education as a lifelong act of co-construction, with plentiful opportunities for work, study, and play for any willing learner.

        Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization on a mission to cultivate peer learning communities in public spaces around the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Born out of the 2008 Cape Town Open Education Declaration, P2PU has remained active at the forefront of open education ever since, establishing the first open badging standard with Mozilla, developing the tools that supported some of the first Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and nurturing experimental online learning communities with a variety of audiences around the globe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2015, P2PU has worked with libraries and community-based organizations worldwide to realize our mission and vision through a methodology called learning circles: free, facilitated study groups for people who want to learn something together.

          <h3>Peer learning</h3>
          <p>We believe people learn better together. Underlying our work is the conviction that people develop expertise through their own life experiences, that learning happens whenever people share and connect with others, and that feedback is necessary in order to improve.</p>
        </div>

          </div>
          <h3>Community</h3>
          <p>P2PU is a community-centered project, reflected in both what we do and how we do it. We believe that sustained learning communities are best created through grassroots collaboration, not hierarchical mandates.</p>

          </div>
          <h3>Open</h3>
          <p>Our commitment to open is predicated on the belief that we create value not by gatekeeping but by working together, sharing resources, and lowering barriers to entry. P2PU is built on open source technology, and everything we create is free to share, remix, and redistribute. </p>

          <h3>Equity</h3>
          <p>Equity is only possible when we recognize education as a social good rather than a commodity. Furthermore, systemic injustice means that providing access alone is insufficient, and we must actively design for inclusion at every step of the way.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </header>
      <p>
        P2PU was born out of the
        <a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/"
          >2007 Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a
        >
        and has been active in the field of open education ever since. Founded
        by Philipp Schmidt, Delia Browne, Neeru Paharia, Stian Haklev, and Joel
        Thierstein, P2PU was originally driven by the belief that with adequate
        social support, anyone can learn almost anything online for free. This
        strategy reached tens of thousands of learners in more than 50 countries
        across a number of projects and collaborations, including The
        <a href="https://courses.p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/"
          >School of Webcraft</a
        >
        (with Mozilla),
        <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/">School of Open</a> (with
        Creative Commons),
        <a href="http://mechanicalmooc.org/">Mechanical MOOC</a> (with MIT), and
        <a href="http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/index.html"
          >Play With Your Music</a
        >
        (with NYU and Peter Gabriel). P2PU also pioneered early massive open
        online courses through it’s
        <a href="https://courses.p2pu.org/en/groups/list/community/"
          >courses platform</a
        >
        and developed some of the first open badge prototypes in collaboration
        with Mozilla.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2014, P2PU made a strategic decision to stop working exclusively
        online because we were not reaching people who stand to benefit the most
        from the promise of free and open online education. In hopes of reaching
        new audiences, we partnered with Chicago Public Library to run in-person
        study groups for library patrons who wanted to learn together. This
        project became known as learning circles, and over the course of 18
        months, P2PU and CPL managed to dramatically increase completion rates
        and reach new audiences who were new to both online learning and
        postsecondary education. Learning circles also formed strong social
        bonds for citizens from diverse backgrounds who shared common goals, and
        helped to highlight the library as a hub for community learning
        experiences
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the success in Chicago, P2PU created an open source learning
        circle toolkit that is now being used by library systems and community
        centers around the world. Through learning circles, we have maintained
        our vision of providing viable alternatives to mainstream higher
        education with a deeper commitment to equity, access, and empowerment.
        All of our learning circle materials and community tools are
        openly-licensed and free to use.
        <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/"

            <div class="text"><h2>Values</h2></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </header>

      <p>P2PU is driven by three core values:</p>

      <p><strong>Peer learning</strong></p>

      <p>
        Underlying our work is the conviction that learning is a social
        activity. We believe that every person develops expertise through their
        own life experiences, that people learn when they share and connect with
        others, and that feedback is necessary in order to improve.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Community</strong></p>

      <p>
        P2PU is a community-centered project, which is reflected across our
        organization from learning circles to our governance model. We involve
        learners and collaborators in all stages of the design and delivery of
        our work, and believe that sustained learning communities are created
        through grassroots collaboration, not hierarchical mandates.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
      <p>
        Equity in learning is only possible when we recognize education as a
        social good rather than a commodity. A prerequisite to this value is a
        commitment to working openly, leaving the commons better off than we
        found it. However, creating space for access is not enough. Systemic
        injustice means that access does not equal equity, and we must actively
        design for inclusion and accessibility at every step along the way.
      </p>
