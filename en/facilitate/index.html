    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners who want to take 
    freely available online courses together, in-person. We believe that anybody can become a 
    facilitator, and whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 
    dozens across an urban library system, you've come to the right place.</p> 
    
    <p>You can run a Learning Circle with just this guide and an online course, but we highly recommend 
    creating your Learning Circle <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/facilitator/signup/">with our online tools</a>. These tools will 
    generate a webpage where people can signup for your Learning Circle, as well as a create a facilitator dashboard from where you can communicate 
    directly with learners via email or SMS, set up automatic reminders to go out before each Learning Circle, and 
    share weekly feedback with learners, P2PU, and other facilitators around the world.</p>
    
    <p>Now for the fun part. Start reading through this guide by navigating through the tabs to the left, or 
    <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/assets/uploads/learning_circle_downloads/facilitator_handbook.pdf">download it all</a> as a pdf that you can read offline. 
    Either way, you’ll see <i class="fa fa-desktop teal hpicon"></i> <span class="teal-highlights">green highlights</span> throughout that point out where our 
    online tools can support your Learning Circle.</p>
    
    <p>When you’re ready to begin, click on the button below to create your Learning Circle. You’ll have your own Learning Circle webpage ready to share in less than five minutes!</p>
