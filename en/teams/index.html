        <h1>Start a Team</h1>		
        <p>Teams are organized learning circle communities, typically affiliated with library systems and community-based organizations. While anyone can facilitate a learning circle for free, organizations that wish to build a thriving network of learning circles often benefit from additional support and tools. </p>
        <p>Team membership is designed to provide comprehensive guidance via:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Staff Professional Development</li>
          <li>1:1 Support</li>
          <li>Community-Powered OER Library</li>
          <li>Software for Teams</li>
          <li>Community of Practice</li>
          <li>Discounted Additional Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Team membership is offered on a sliding scale between $2,000 - $10,000 per year, calculated based on your organization's annual operating budget.</p>
