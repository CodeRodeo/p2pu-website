    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners who want to take 
    freely available online courses together, in-person. We believe that anybody can become a 
    facilitator, and whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 
    dozens across an urban library system, the Learning Circle Guide is here to help you get going.</p> 
    
    <p>You can run a Learning Circle with just this guide and an online course, but we highly recommend 
    you run your Learning Circle using our free software tools. Our web app will generate a website where 
    people can signup for your Learning Circle, and it will also grant you a facilitator dashboard to communicate 
    directly with learners via email or SMS, set up automatic reminders to go out before each Learning Circle, and 
    share weekly feedback with learners, P2PU, and other facilitators around the world.</p>
    
    <p>Now for the fun part. Start reading through this guide online by navigating through the tabs to the left, or 
    click on Downloads to access a pdf version of everything you see here. Whether you read it online or offline, you’ll 
    see <span class="teal-highlights">teal highlights</span> throughout the guide that point out where our software can support 
    your Learning Circle.</p>
    
    <p>When you’re ready to start marketing your Learning Circle, click on the button below to get set up with out software. 
    It’s free, and you’ll have your own Learning Circle webpage ready to share in less than five minutes!</p>
