    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners 
    who want to take freely available online courses together, in-person. We
     believe that anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to 
    run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an 
    urban library system, this guide is here to help you get going.</p> 
    <p>The first part - <span class="bold">Background</span> - provides 
    introductory information about Learning Circles and the type of learning
     that the format aims to develop. The second part - <span class="bold">Getting Started</span> - includes the steps you need to check off before beginning. The third part - <span class="bold">Running a Learning Circle</span> - introduces facilitation tips and the guidelines for the routine you’quot;ll develop each week. The final part - <span class="bold">Appendix</span> - includes additional tools and templates to make your Learning Circle as good as it can be.</p>

    <p class="space-top">This handbook was developed by <span class="bold">Peer 2 Peer University</span> and <span class="bold">Chicago Public Library</span>, with support from the <span class="bold">Knight Foundation News Challenge</span>
     and a great deal of help from Anna Häggman and Katherine McConachie. We
     are grateful to everyone who contributed to the underlying thinking and
     structure of Learning Circles, especially the librarians and patrons in
     Chicago who pioneered this work with us in 2015.</p>


    <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
    <p>For decades, online learning has offered the potential to deliver 
    cheap, flexible education to a large audience. As the field of online 
    growing has increased rapidly in the past few years, many advocates have
     claimed that online learning will democratize higher education and even
     make universities obsolete.</p> 
    <p>However, there are several barriers that have prevented such a 
    democratization from occurring. In order to succeed in learning online, 
    individuals must already be web savvy, self-directed learners with a 
    great deal of intrinsic motivation and discipline. Given this, it is not
     a surprise that the vast majority of those who complete online courses 
    already have a Bachelor’quot;s degree.</p>
    <p>It is these two phenomena – the volume of high quality online 
    learning resources and the mounting evidence that they have not leveled 
    the educational playing field – that inspired Learning Circles. In early
     2015, P2PU and Chicago Public Library started working together to 
    deliver online courses in a supportive and engaging library environment 
    across Chicago. Specifically targeting adult learners who do not yet 
    have an undergraduate degree, Learning Circles were designed to equip 
    learners with confidence and motivation, springboarding them into future
     educational and professional endeavors.</p>

    <h2>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h2>
    <p>For decades, the web has allowed teachers and institutions to publish
     course materials online. While some institutions and individuals 
    pioneered online learning with low-cost degree programs, others began to
     publish stand-alone course materials online for free. By the early 
    2000s, many freely-available online learning materials became unified 
    under a banner known as Open Educational Resources (OER), broadly 
    defined as “teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in 
    the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property 
    license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others”.</p>
    <p>Around 2008, individuals and institutions starting “running” free 
    online courses synchronously, where learners from around the world could
     sign up and work through course materials together. These experiments 
    were coined as MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses.</p>

    <h2>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)</h2>
    <p>It didn’quot;t take long for MOOCs to catch on. Initially they were run by
     individual instructors at different institutions, but soon large 
    universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Stanford started designing their 
    own MOOC platforms and partnering with universities around the world to 
    transform courses into MOOCs and publish them online for anyone to use.</p> 
    <p>Some MOOCs are digital versions of existing courses, where professors
     deliver their lectures via video and upload readings to a website. 
    Others take advantage of the online medium, and create new learning 
    experiences for online learners. One thing most MOOCs share is that they
     require learners to be self-directed and motivated, and to be 
    comfortable working online. Because of this, the vast majority of 
    participants drop out of MOOCs without finishing.</p> 
    <p>Learning Circles position MOOCs in a social space. Emphasizing <span class="bold">peer learning</span> and <span class="bold">academic mindset</span>
     growth, a diverse group of learners can now benefit from online 
    learning as they develop cognitive skills, explore new learning 
    strategies, and improve their digital literacy in a social space.</p>

    <h2>Peer learning</h2>
    <p class="list-below">There are three values that underlie P2PU’quot;s concept of peer learning:</p>  
    <ul>
    <li>Everybody’quot;s an expert in something</li>
    <li>Sharing is how we learn best</li>
    <li>Feedback is necessary in order to improve </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By convening a group of learners who are interested in a similar 
    topic, you’quot;ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning 
    environment that has the the potential to be the support system many 
    learners need. Peer learning can create a rich learning environment in 
    which everyone simultaneously teaches and learns, acts and observes, 
    speaks and listens. This exposes learners of all stripes and sizes to 
    new perspectives, provides an opportunity to develop useful social 
    skills, and allows individuals to achieve something greater than they 
    could have on their own.</p>

    <h2>Academic mindsets</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Academic mindsets is a term used to describe the 
    beliefs that learners have about themselves, their intelligence, and 
    their abilities. These mindsets influence a learner’quot;s motivation and 
    perseverance, which in turn influences their study habits and overall 
    academic performance. A positive academic mindset is described in four 
    statements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“I belong to this community”</li>
    <li>“My ability and competence grow with my effort”</li>
    <li>“I can succeed at this”</li>
    <li>“This work has value for me”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learning Circles support academic mindsets by combining group 
    activities with course content. These activities will help learners 
    develop a learning community, set and achieve attainable goals, develop 
    new learning strategies, connect the work to their goals, and reflect 
    and improve upon the Learning Circle model. Many learners have told us 
    that the development of these skills is equally or even more powerful 
    than learning new content from the online material.</p>

    <h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>

    <p>You can compress or expand this timeline to suit your needs. However,
     if you don’quot;t already have a dedicated group of learners, we recommend 
    spending four weeks promoting your Learning Circle once you’quot;ve finalized
     the date, time, course, and location.</p>

    <h4 class="green">6 weeks prior</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Discuss plans with any affiliated organizations</li>
    <li>Choose a course</li>
    <li>Find a space</li>
    <li>Choose date and time</li>
    <li>Confirm supplies available</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="green">4 weeks prior</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Establish a web presence</li>
    <li>Prepare application</li>
    <li>Customize the flyer</li>
    <li>Connect with local communities</li>
    <li>Publicize online and offline</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="green">2 weeks prior</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Confirm with all applicants</li>
    <li>Confirm with venue</li>
    <li>Gather supplies</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="green">Before each Learning Circle</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Send reminder email</li>
    <li>Explore the online course</li>
    <li>Review recipe card</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="green">1 week after</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Send final wrap up to learners</li>
    <li>Share feedback with P2PU</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choose a course</h2>
    <p>There are many online providers that offer free online courses to the
     public. But not all courses are created equal. Here are 3 steps to 
    choosing the perfect online course:</p>

    <h3>1. Get to know your community</h3>
    <p>You need to identify a course that will resonate with the learners 
    you anticipate working with. Here are a few questions to get you 
    thinking:</p>


    <h4>What knowledge gaps exist in your community?</h4> 
    <p>Is there a need for subjects that aren’quot;t available where you live? 
    Examples include learning Spanish, preparing for the GED, or building a 
    website with HTML/CSS.</p>
    <h4>Who do you expect to attend?</h4>
    <p>If you’quot;ll be working with learners who aren’quot;t fully employed, you may
     want to choose a course that supports finding new work or skilling up 
    (such as resume writing, public speaking, or academic writing). Be sure 
    to look at the prerequisites for the courses and make sure the content 
    isn’quot;t too basic or too advanced and advertise appropriately.</p>
    <h4>What would you like to learn?</h4> 
    <p>If you are passionate about the subject matter, it will resonate with learners.</p>


    <h3>2. Identify possible courses</h3>
    <p class="list-below">here are a number of ways to search for online courses. Here are a few options:</p>
    <ul class="list-below">
    <li>Head over to <a href="https://goo.gl/ipnD7B" target="_blank">p2pu.org/facilitate#courses</a>
     to see courses we’quot;ve used in the past. Here you’quot;ll also find platform 
    guides for getting started with courses from each of the providers 
    listed below.</li>
    <li>Check out <a href="https://www.class-central.com/" target="_blank">class-central.com</a>, a good aggregator of all online courses.</li>
    <li>Search by subject by platform. Platforms we’quot;ve worked with in the past include:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="sublist">
    <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">FutureLearn</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseware</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://novoed.com/" target="_blank">NovoEd</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Choose the best fit</h3>
    <p>Once you’quot;ve identified a few courses that will interest your 
    community, whittle the list down further. Use these criteria to identify
     good courses for your Learning Circle:</p>
    <h4>Logistics: Does the course meet the course criteria?</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Free (free enrolment and free access to all course materials)</li>
    <li>English-medium (or whichever language you choose)</li>
    <li>CC-licensed (ideal, but not essential)</li>
    <li>Either open enrollment or a start date that suits your schedule</li>
    <li>Not too long (we recommend 5-8 week long courses)</li>
    <li>Low weekly commitment (varies if learners commit to doing additional work)</li>
    <li>No additional software required aside from browser and a word processor</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Relevance to your community</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Is the subject matter interesting and relevant to the learners you anticipate working with?</li>
    <li>Are there prerequisites that will prevent many people from taking this course?</li>
    <li>Is the subject matter interesting for you to facilitate/study alongside learners?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Quality of Instruction</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Does the mode of instruction seem engaging and effective?</li>
    <li>Are the course materials and the platform intuitive to use?</li>
    <li>Is there a clear sense of expertise present in the course materials?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Coherent as a Learning Circle</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Is it easy for learners to give and receive feedback to each other?</li>
    <li>Do the activities make sense being done together as group work?</li>
    <li>Can you imagine this course being run in person?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Opportunities for feedback</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Do the assessments seem to reinforce course materials?</li>
    <li>Is there an active online community/access to mentors?</li>
    <li>Is there a clear way to get in touch with someone on the website if you run into technical difficulties?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Find a space</h2>
    <p>Find a quiet space you can use consistently for the duration of the 
    Learning Circle for about 90 minutes/week. If possible, reserve the room
     ahead of time.</p>

    <h4>Essentials</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Easily accessible space</li>
    <li>Consistent access to power</li>
    <li>Consistent access to free internet</li>
    <li>Access to restrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Desirables</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>A large wall that you can use a projector on</li>
    <li>Natural light (<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-11/sp-rrf103114.php" target="_blank">studies show</a> that people learn better with it)</li>
    <li>Modular seating arrangements</li>
    <li>Near public transport / free parking</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Make sure</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Have the times been booked for all 6 weeks?</li>
    <li>Do you have access to any keys that you need?</li>
    <li>Do you know the wifi network name and password?</li>
    <li>Do you know where chairs, tables, and additional supplies are stored?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Gather supplies</h2>
    <h4>There are a few things you should have ready before Learning Circles begin</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Laptops for all participants (if they don’quot;t have their own)</li>
    <li>Headphones for participants (if they don’quot;t have their own)</li>
    <li>Internet browser (such as Google Chrome) and word processor such as Google Docs, Pages, or Microsoft Word</li>
    <li>Any additional software the course might require (this is rare)</li>
    <li>A projector and relevant HDMI or Mini DisplayPort adapter</li>
    <li>Adequate number of powerstrips and adapters</li>
    <li>Phone/camera (to record and share materials)</li>
    <li>Notebook and a pen</li>
    <li>Name tags (use them until you are sure everybody is familiar with each other)</li>
    <li>A few extra applications (for walk-ins)</li>
    <li>Snacks (if possible/appropriate)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Identify learners</h2>
    <p>Learning Circles work best with small, enthusiastic groups of people -
     ideally between 4 and 10 learners. We recommend that you start these 
    promotion activities 4 weeks before your Circle starts.</p>

    <h3>1. Establish a web presence</h3>
    <p class="highlightp">If you are using our software, you’quot;ll have a link to your Learning Circle’quot;s website that you can share freely.</p>
    <p>Consider creating and sharing a public event on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or an online event registration site such as <a href="https://goo.gl/6E9vYX" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a>. When you publicize online, include the link to your Learning Circle.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the application</h3>
    <p class="highlightp">If you are using our software, learners can apply online when you share the link to your Learning Circle.</p> 
    <p>We’quot;ve put together a brief application (see Appendix) that you should
     share alongside your digital marketing. Depending on the topic of your 
    course, you may want to ensure that everyone has a basic level of 
    digital skills in order to fully participate in and benefit from the 
    group.</p>

    <h4>The application includes</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Name and email address/phone number (so you know can contact them).</li>
    <li>Goals (so you know what they are looking to get out of it).</li>
    <li>How they’quot;ll help their peers (to get them thinking about peer learning).</li>
    <li>Quick digital skills self-assessment (so you can see the range of 
    digital comfort in the course). We find that scoring 15 or higher makes 
    you a good candidate for a Learning Circle.</li>
    <li>Whether they have a laptop and headphones (if they don’quot;t have a 
    laptop and you can’quot;t provide extras, then these people will not be able 
    to attend unless they can figure out a way to borrow one. Headphones are
     useful but not essential in some courses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Customize the flyer</h3>
    <p class="list-below">Eye-catching flyers and posters are an excellent 
    way to promote your Learning Circle, both digitally and in print. We’quot;ve 
    included a template (see Appendix), but feel free to get creative and 
    make your own! Just remember to include the following information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Name of the course</li>
    <li>Date, time and venue of the meetings</li>
    <li>How many weeks the course will run for</li>
    <li>Anything participants should bring with them</li>
    <li>A contact number, weblink or email address where people can find out more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Print the poster and put it in noticeable places around your venue, 
    such as entrances, information or library circulation desks, computer 
    terminals, or near other resources related to the course you are 
    running. You can also share the flyer with organisations, community 
    groups, local coffee shops or bookstores - any place where potential 
    learners may wander!</p>


    <h3>4. Reach out to your communities</h3>
    <p>Now that your materials are ready, you can start identifying 
    learners. Nobody understands your networks better than you do, so you’quot;ll
     know the best way to reach them. We’quot;ve provided templates that you can 
    use to get started in a number of different mediums.</p>
     
    <h4>1.1 Email</h4>
    <p>Do you use a mailing list? If so, you might want to use this message to find potential learners (feel free to adapt it too!):</p>

    <p class="template">Are you interested in taking a free and open online 
    course, but don’quot;t want to study alone? Why not join our Learning Circle,
     and study face-to-face with your peers?</p>
    <p class="template">From _______ (date) ________ to _______ (date) 
    _______ we’quot;ll be meeting in _______ (venue) _______ to work together 
    through a course on ________ (subject) _______ in a supportive, 
    peer-oriented group. We won’quot;t have a teacher - we’quot;ll be teaching each 
    other!</p>
    <p class="template">There are no prerequisites for the course, but access to a laptop and some experience of using the Web would be helpful.</p>
    <p class="template">For more information, visit _______ (link to any 
    online advertising) _______ or send an email to ________ (your email) 
    _______ and we will send you a link to an application and more 
    information.</p>


    <h4>1.2 Facebook</h4>
    <p>Does your community use Facebook? If so, try this post as a first 
    step. Remember, people get a lot of information via social media, so to 
    be really impactful, post reminders to Facebook about once per day. 
    Remember to tag any individuals, projects, locations or groups who you 
    think might be interested in joining your Circle.</p>

    <p class="template">Interested in online learning? Don’quot;t want to do it 
    alone? Join a #LearningCircle at ______(venue)_______ for free 
    face-to-face groups who meet regularly to study online courses together.
     Circles start ______(start date)______. For more information and to 
    apply online:  _______ (link to any online advertising) _______.</p>


    <h4>1.3 Twitter</h4>
    <p>If your community uses Twitter for sharing information, then you can 
    use the two template Tweets below to get started. To really get noticed,
     you should tweet these messages at least 3 times per day, and come up 
    with a hashtag so people can search for the messages. Remember to add 
    the link to your Circle, too!</p>

    <p class="template">Learn online, in-person, in ______(venue)_______ 
    .Online courses done face-to-face. #learningcircles start _______(start 
    date)________ 2016</p>

    <p class="template">In #(your city’quot;s name)? Want to learn in-person, in 
    your local library? We’quot;re hosting #learningcircles in 
    ______(venue)_______. See venue for details.</p> 


    <h3>5. Reach out to other community groups</h3>
    <p>Depending on the topic of your Circle, you should consider reaching 
    out to other local organisations who share an interest in the subject. 
    For example, local historical societies will have members who are 
    interested in history courses and youth groups might be interested in 
    courses which train young people who are looking for jobs.</p>

    <p>If your Circle is taking place in a venue that has a schedule, public
     calendar or newsletter, ask the administrators if you can add a notice 
    about the Circle - these are very good ways of reaching potential 
    participants. Likewise, if your venue uses social media ask them to post
     and tweet on your behalf.</p>


    <p class="template">Dear ____________</p>
    <p class="template">We thought you might be interested in a learning 
    project taking place in your community. We are going to be hosting a 
    Learning Circle - a free, peer-led study group for learners who want to 
    take online courses together in a public space. </p>

    <p class="template">Each week, learners will meet for approximately 90 
    minutes to work through learning materials about _______(subject)_______
     together. </p>

    <p class="template">The Circle will run from _____(start time)_______ to
     _____(end time)______ on the following dates _____(Circle dates)_____ 
    in the following venue _____(venue)_____. </p>

    <p class="template">Please pass this message on to anyone in your 
    community who you think might be interested, and get in touch if you 
    have any questions.</p> 

    <p class="template">Regards</p>

    <p class="template">____________________</p>


    <h3>6. Confirm with the learners</h3>
    <p class="highlightp">If you are using our software, you can log on to your dashboard to view applications and get in touch with applicants.</p>
    <p>As learners apply, you should confirm whether or not they will be 
    part of the group. If their skill level seems too low, suggest that they
     turn to their local library or other community learning space where 
    digital literacy is taught. Remember, everyone is a beginner sometime, 
    so be sure to be encouraging and supportive when you direct people 
    elsewhere.</p>
    <p>We’quot;ve created a sample acceptance and decline message that you can use when you respond to applicants.</p> 

    <h4>Sample Acceptance message</h4>

    <p class="template">Dear _______________</p> 

    <p class="template">Thanks for getting in touch and wanting to join the 
    Learning Circle about ______(subject)_______ starting ______(date)_____.
     From the signup information you shared, you look like you’quot;ll be a 
    perfect fit for the Circle. We look forward to having you join us.</p>  

    <p class="template">We’quot;ll be sending more information about the Circle soon.</p>  

    <h4>Sample Decline message</h4>

    <p class="template">Dear _______________</p>

    <p class="template">Thanks for getting in touch and wanting to join the 
    Learning Circle on _______(subject)_______  starting ______(date)______.
     From the signup information you shared, it looks like the level of 
    digital skills required for the course aren’quot;t quite right for you. You 
    might want to consider approaching your local library branch, community 
    centre or citizens advice bureau to find out where you can learn the 
    skills and take the courses that you are interested in.</p> 

    <p class="template">Good luck with your online learning adventure!</p>

    <h1 id="running-a-learning-circle">Running Learning Circles</h1>
    <p>Everyone attends Learning Circles for different reasons. Some people 
    want to build social relationships in a quasi-academic setting, others 
    are there because they want to learn the skills they need to get a new 
    job, and others attend purely for the sake of learning something new. As
     a facilitator, it is your job to understand individual’quot;s motivation for
     joining, and cultivate an environment in which learners can clearly see
     how the Learning Circle will help them achieve their desired goals.</p> 
    <p>To help you achieve this, we’quot;ve included some handy tips from past 
    facilitators, followed by an outline of the general flow that your 
    Learning Circle will develop.</p>


    <h2>Facilitation tips</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Good facilitation includes a number of different tasks:</p>
    <ul> 
    <li>Listen to learners</li>
    <li>Ask clarifying statements</li>
    <li>Provide good feedback</li>
    <li>Keep discussions on task</li>
    <li>Probe assumptions and evidence</li>
    <li>Elicit viewpoints and perspectives</li>
    <li>Mediate conflicts</li>
    <li>Summarize and present findings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’quot;s a lot, but don’quot;t worry, nobody is expecting you to be perfect 
    from day one, and it will become much easier with practice. Here are 
    some suggestions:</p>

    <h4>Model peer learning</h4>
    <p>For most people, learning has been a passive experience of 
    “receiving” instruction. They may be unaccustomed to taking 
    responsibility for their own and the group’quot;s learning. This is not what 
    Learning Circles are about and it is important to be clear about this, 
    especially in the first few weeks. As a facilitator, you can be a role 
    model for the group by engaging learners in problem-solving and actively
     reaching out to help when possible.</p>

    <h4>Maintain awareness</h4>
    <p>Be observant, and learn to read the energy of the room. Who seems 
    really motivated today? Who is particularly quiet? Once you have an 
    understanding of the learner’quot;s goals, you’quot;ll be able to respond to this 
    energy productively. Is one learner quiet because they are struggling 
    with a basic concept? Ask somebody who is a few steps ahead if they 
    don’quot;t mind helping out.</p>

    <h4>Strive to help participants self-identify as members of their group</h4>
    <p class="list-below">This is called social cohesion. Social cohesion 
    begins to develop within an hour of people being together. Some examples
     for encouraging social cohesion include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Agreeing on a group name</li>
    <li>Using non-verbal symbols (mascot, logo, colors)</li>
    <li>Establishing rituals (traditions, habits, weekly activities)</li>
    <li>Using plural pronouns (“we” instead of “I”)</li>
    <li>Invoking group metaphors (referring to group as family, team, etc.)</li>
    <li>Making verbal pledges, (commitments to future action)</li>
    <li>Establishing group narrative (saying things like “Remember when we…”)</li>
    <li>Developing groupspeak (inside jokes, jargon)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ask probing questions</h4>
    <p>Learners will ask you many content related questions, since you are 
    the closest thing to the traditional teacher in the room. When a learner
     asks, your response should demonstrate that their peers are a valuable 
    resource, and that most questions are answerable if you know where to 
    look. Examples of responses you might give are:
    I’quot;m not sure, did you ask anyone else if they ran up against the same 
    problem?
    Hmmm, where would you start looking to figure that out?</p> 

    <h4>Encourage meaningful, frequent interactions between members.</h4> 
    <p>Shared emotional connections serve the dual purpose of helping 
    individuals learn and reinforcing community. Watch out for questions or 
    conversations that de-focus the group, and feel comfortable steering 
    conversations back on track. Other participants will greatly appreciate 
    this.</p>


    <h4>Manage expectations</h4>
    <p>When learning something new, there is a fine line between being 
    optimistic and discouraged. To navigate this, express confidence that 
    learners can achieve their goals, while also being realistic and aware 
    of what is possible in six weeks. For instance, it is unlikely that 
    somebody with no programming background will get a programming job after
     one HTML/CSS Learning Circle. However, they will gain a better 
    understanding of how to build a website, get a sense as to whether this 
    is a subject they’quot;d like to continue in, and have a peer group of 
    like-minded individuals they’quot;ve gotten to know.</p>  

    <h4>Encourage growth mindsets</h4> 
    <p>A growth mindset is the belief that one’quot;s skills and abilities can be
     continually developed through hard work, rather than stay fixed at a 
    certain point. As a facilitator, try praising a learner’quot;s processes 
    (effort, strategies, choices) rather than their innate intelligence 
    (you’quot;re so smart!).</p> 

    <h4>Turn frustrations around</h4> 
    <p>Try to flip frustrations into positive statements and involve the 
    group. When one learner felt that the interview tips in a Job Training 
    course were too basic, the facilitator asked the group if they could 
    come up with better tips.This re-framed the frustration in a positive 
    way and served as an opportunity for learners to work together.</p> 

    <h4>Delegate responsibilities</h4> 
    <p class="list-below">A good facilitator empowers learners to take 
    charge of their own learning, making the role of the facilitator smaller
     and smaller over time. As the Circle progresses, the facilitator can 
    start asking learners to take on some extra responsibility, such as:</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>Send a wrap-up email afterwards reflecting on the day’quot;s class</li>
    <li>Summarize the week’quot;s material at the beginning of each class</li>
    <li>Set up/clean up the space</li>
    <li>Share a resource or article that relates to the course content</li>
    <li>Help a learner who is struggling</li>
    <li>Bring snacks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Be reflective</h4>
    <p class="list-below">As a facilitator, you have a great deal of 
    influence over the atmosphere in your Circle. Ask yourself the following
     questions as you work through the 6 weeks:</p>
    <ul> 
    <li>How might my cultural assumptions influence my interactions with learners?</li> 
    <li>How might the backgrounds and experiences of learners influence their motivation, engagement, and learning?</li>
    <li>How can I modify course materials, activities, facilitation 
    techniques, and expectations to be more accessible to all the learners 
    in my Learning Circle?</li>
    </ul>




    <h2>Beforehand</h2>
    There are three things to do each week about two days before your Learning Circle.
    <ul>
    <li>Send confirmation email to all participants.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="template">“Hi everyone, this is a reminder that we have our 
    Learning Circle in two days on ______(date)______ at ______(time)______ 
    in ______(location)______. Please let me know if you can’quot;t make it… I 
    look forward to seeing you all!</p>

    <ul class="list-below">
    <li>If you are using our software, these messages will be sent to out 
    automatically 48 hours each Learning Circle. You will receive an email 
    beforehand giving you the option to edit the text before it is sent.</li>
    <li>Review the supplies checklist to make sure you have everything you need.</li>
    <li>Familiarize yourself with the week’quot;s learning materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="sublist">
    <li>What is the main subject matter learners will be covering this week?</li>
    <li>How does this tie in to the major goals of the course?</li>
    <li>Are there any activities this week that could easily be done as a group?</li>
    <li>How can the weekly recipe card activities support the course content?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>During</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Each Learning Circle has four components, 
    documented weekly on the recipe cards (see Appendix). You can decide to 
    follow the format of the recipe cards as much or as little as you’quot;d 
    like, as you are in the best position to understand the goals and 
    backgrounds of the learners. In general the four components are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Check-in:</span> The first ten minutes are spent reviewing the past week and sharing goals for the day.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Activity:</span> Each recipe card has a 10-15 
    minute activity that you can facilitate before or after the coursework. 
    These are designed to foster community, build learner confidence, and 
    help to bridge the course content and real life. We recommend you 
    explain the activity to learners and then decide as a group if you’quot;d 
    like to do it. Feel free to come up with your own!</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Coursework:</span> The majority of each Learning Circle is devoted to working through the online course.</li> 
    <li><span class="bold">Plus/delta:</span> The last five minutes are spent sharing one thing that went well and one thing that learners hope to improve next week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Afterwards</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Once the learners leave, spend about ten minutes wrapping up all the week’quot;s work.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Clean up.</li>
    <li>Return anything you borrowed.</li>
    <li>Send a short summary email to all the learners (a template is included at the bottom of each recipe card).</li>
    <li class="highlightli">If you are using our software, you can capture 
    your feedback for the meeting on the facilitator dashboard. This 
    feedback will be automatically shared with learners 48 hours before the 
    next meeting.</li>
    <li>During the final Learning Circle, distribute certificates and surveys (see Appendix).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="appendix" class="green">Appendix</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 1 - Getting Started</h2>

    <p class="bold">This recipe card covers important introductions that 
    should happen during your first meeting. Take about 10 minutes to give 
    an overview of the Learning Circle process.</p>

    <h6><span>Introduction (10 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Start by introducing Learning Circles and the course you are 
    facilitating. Then take some time to answer logistical questions from 
    participants. Talking points are below.</p>

    <h6><span>Introducing Learning Circles</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Many universities and institutions have begun developing free, online courses as a way to increase access to education.</li>
    <li>These courses have very low completion rates, because taking a 
    course alone, online, requires a lot of self-discipline, motivation, and
     prior knowledge of how online learning works.</li>
    <li>Learning Circles, developed by Chicago Public Library and Peer 2 
    Peer University, are an attempt to create a more engaging learning 
    experiences using this free, online content, but doing it in-person!</li>
    <li>Learning Circles are free peer learning courses; a combination of a 
    book club, study hall, and support group. Together we will try and help 
    each other accomplish our learning goals.</li>
    <li>There are many ways to contribute. Some people might be more 
    advanced technically, but other people might have unique insights that 
    other people would not have noticed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Course Overview and Logistics</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Discuss some of the specific themes of your course, what the 
    learning goals are, what kind of work participants can expect to be 
    doing.</li>
    <li>There are few prerequisites for taking this course: basic digital 
    literacy, a desire to learn, and willingness to work together with your 
    peers.</li>
    <li>We will meet at this time, for 90 minutes, for the next 6 weeks. 
    Each week I will send you a reminder about our next meeting and a 
    summary of what we did the week before.</li> 
    <li>There is no necessary work outside of the Learning Circle, but as a 
    group we can decide if we want to work on the course material outside of
     the weekly session (The more work we do, the more progress we will 
    make!)</li> 
    <li>You can get a certificate if you complete the online course and/or attend 5 Learning Circles.</li>
    <li>My role as a facilitator is to support you in your learning. I am not a teacher or content expert.</li>
    <li>This is the most I’quot;ll ever be speaking at once during the Learning 
    Circle. I have these cards which suggest activities and discussion 
    points, but this is our space and we can choose to make it however we 
    want.</li> 
    </ul>


    <h6><span>Questions (10 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Open the floor to questions from participants.</p>




    <p class="bold">The goal for the rest of the session is to strike a 
    balance between giving learners a chance to jump right into the course 
    and taking time to create a comfortable space for the fledgling 
    community. Both are important to the success of the Learning Circle.</p>

    <h6><span>Get to know one another (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <p class="list-below">As the facilitator, it is important for you to 
    prompt personal introductions in a way that will encourage conversation 
    amongst the whole group. Frame this activity as a way for all of the 
    participants to get to know one another, as a starting point for the 
    work they’quot;ll be doing together over the next 6 weeks – this activity is 
    for them, not for you.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Ask learners to share why they came
     to the Learning Circle and an example of a good learning experience 
    they have had in their life.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Model an introduction by re-introducing yourself to start.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Afterwards, summarize the 
    learning experiences and share how you think this Learning Circle can 
    develop into an inclusive learning community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (45 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Direct participants to the course website and have them create an 
    account on the platform. Use platform guides on P2PU website as needed.</li>
    <li>Encourage learners to poke around on the platform, together or on their own.</li> 
    <li>To wrap up, ask participants to come back together as a group and 
    share with the broader group some of the things they learned or are 
    excited to start learning about.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Activity: Group expectations (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <p class="list-below">Talk about expectations for the group to draw in 
    participation from all group members and help craft group identity. It’quot;s
     ok if not everybody agrees on everything!</p>
    <ul class="list-below">
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Ask learners how they want to work with their peers in the coming weeks. Prompt learners with these questions:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="sublist">
    <li>Do you want to work through activities on a projector or work on their own?</li>
    <li>Do you want to commit to doing work outside of the Learning Circle?</li>
    <li>Do you feel like you have enough time to complete the course?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Based on the discussion create a 
    list of expectations for their group and discuss the list, leaving room 
    for last minute additions and any disagreements.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Once the list is final, read the final list to the group.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Plus/delta (5 min)</span></h6> 
    ​<p style="margin-top:-26px;">Ask learners to share one thing that went 
    well for them today, and one thing that they would like to change for 
    next week. You should record these weekly, as each subsequent Learning 
    Circle will begin by revisiting the prior weeks plus/deltas. This 
    activity is a great way to reflect on the course and constantly strive 
    to improve the experience for learners. Make clear that the changes the 
    participants mention will be revisited in the following class and 
    integrated into the flow of the course.</p>

    <h6><span>Feedback (afterwards)</span></h6> 
    <p>Send a feedback email to learners each week. Include your impressions
     of how it went, plus/delta feedback, and anything the group agreed to 
    for next week.</p>
    <p class="teal">If you are using our software, you can submit this via the facilitator dashboard.</p>


    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 2 - Goal setting</h2>


    <p class="bold">As the group continues to evolve into a learning 
    community, this week’quot;s activity is designed to support learners in 
    defining and setting personal goals for the Learning Circle. These goals
     will become the focal point of the weekly check-in for subsequent 
    weeks.</p>

    <h6><span>Check-in (10 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Recap last week’quot;s plus/delta</li>
    <li>Start stand ups this week. Go around and ask learners to share “what
     I worked on last week, what I am working on this week, and what I’quot;ll 
    need help on.”</li>

    </ul>

    <h6><span>Activity: Goal setting (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <p class="list-below">Goal setting and sharing is a powerful tool to 
    help learners craft group identity, increase motivation, and build 
    confidence. By setting goals early, learners will be able to refer to 
    these on a weekly basis to track their progress over time.</p>
    <ul class="list-below">
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Ask the learners to spend 5 minutes
     writing down one or two major learning goals for themselves for the 
    Learning Circle. Encourage them to look through the course syllabus 
    online to help identify course goals that resonate with them, or 
    identify other personal goals they might have. Prompt learners with this
     question:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="sublist green">
    <li>“What do you want to know or be able to do by the end of this 
    course? Some examples are “I want to do all of the readings, or I want 
    to complete the final project, or I want to help everybody in the 
    Learning Circle at least once.” These are all good goals because they 
    are specific, difficult yet achievable in 6 weeks, and have clear 
    checkpoints that you can make progress towards each week.” </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="list-below">
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Have learners break into small 
    groups of 3-4 or come together as a larger group (if there are less than
     6 people) to share their goals. As each learner presents, the group 
    should help them improve their goals by making them more specific, at a 
    reasonable level of difficulty, and with clear checkpoints. Examples of 
    questions they might ask include:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="sublist green">
    <li>What specific actions can you take to reach your goals? How can we help?</li>
    <li>Can you break down your goals to checkpoints so that you can see progress each week?</li>
    <li>Do you think this goal is reasonable in 6 weeks?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Have each individual write down 
    their individual goals and checkpoints somewhere, and keep a master list
     yourself that you can refer back to over time. Let everybody know that 
    starting next week, learners will share their goal at the beginning of 
    each Learning Circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (65 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Check in with learners who didn’quot;t seem confident about their goals to see how they are progressing.</p>

    <h6><span>Plus/delta (5 min)</span></h6> 
    <p>Ask learners to share one thing that went well for them today, and one thing that they would like to change for next week.</p>

    <h6><span>Feedback (afterwards)</span></h6>  
    <p>Send summary to all the learners including a quick summary of the 
    session, the plus/delta feedback, a summary of the goal setting activity
     and anything else you want the learners to remember for next week.</p>


    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 3 - Critique and feedback</h2>


    <p class="bold">Giving and receiving feedback are a very important parts
     of Learning Circles. This week focuses on building the learners’quot; 
    confidence in turning to the group for help and support, and talking 
    together about what the benefits of critique are and what are good ways 
    to give and receive it.</p>

    <h6><span>Check-in (10 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Recap last week’quot;s plus/delta</li>
    <li>Stand-up: what I worked on last week, what I am working on this week, and what I’quot;ll need help on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (45 min)</span></h6>
    <ul> 
    <li>While working, ask learners to think of one thing from the course 
    that they would like feedback on (such as a draft of a paper, a mockup 
    of a website, or an updated resume). Tell them that, if they are 
    comfortable, they will share these during the activity today.</li>
    <li>Does everyone seem settled into a routine? If not, spend a little extra time with them.</li>
    <li>If digital skills are still holding any participants back, consider recommending a different course for them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Activity: Critique and feedback (30 min)</span></h6> 
    <p class="list-below">Modeling good feedback and constructive criticism 
    can help make learners more comfortable sharing with one another. If 
    this is something that the learners like, you can incorporate it into 
    future sessions as well. Use a projector if that will help everyone look
     on together.</p>

    <ul class="list-below">
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Introduce the sessions with the following prompt:
    </li></ul>
    <ul class="sublist green">
    <li>We all learn from other people, which means that giving and 
    receiving constructive criticism is essential for us to reach our 
    potential. Critical feedback may be awkward sometimes, so there are a 
    few good rules of thumb to follow. First, when you are giving feedback, 
    try to include something positive about your colleague’quot;s work, and make 
    your recommendations specific and actionable, so that they know how to 
    address the feedback that you raise. When you are receiving feedback, 
    try to listen with open ears, and remember that we all have each other’quot;s
     best interests at heart. If you feel yourself feeling defensive, try 
    asking a clarifying question rather than assuming the person is 
    attacking your work.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: One by one, have learners share 
    their work (either by presenting it verbally or showing it on the 
    projector or a laptop). If learners are looking for feedback on a 
    specific component, they can mention that beforehand.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: If any learners feel particularly
     distraught about their feedback, help them make a plan for getting back
     on track during the next Learning Circle.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Plus/delta (5 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Ask learners to share one thing that went well for them today, and one thing that they would like to change for next week.</p> 

    <h6><span>Feedback (afterwards)</span></h6>
    <p>Send summary to all the learners including a quick summary of the 
    session, the plus/delta feedback, and anything else you want the 
    learners to remember for next week. Make sure to remind learners to 
    bring something to share next week (see Week 4 activity).</p>



    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 4 - Sharing</h2>

    <p class="bold">In the past, learners have enjoyed getting a chance to 
    hear and share stories about past experiences related to the course 
    material. It is a nice way for the learners to bring more of their 
    personality in the group, especially for those learners who tend to be 
    more quiet or reserved.</p>

    <h6><span>Check-in (10 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Recap last week’quot;s plus/delta.</li>
    <li>Stand-up: what I worked on last week, what I am working on this week, and what I’quot;ll need help on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Activity: Sharing (15 min)</span></h6>
    <p class="list-below">Try to strike a balance between learners sharing 
    something personal that also directly relates to the course material. In
     the past, public speaking learners have shared speeches they love from 
    YouTube, HTML/CSS learners have shared their favorite website, and 
    Registered Nursing exam prep learners have shared embarrassing stories 
    from nursing school.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Ask a learner to introduce a relevant resource/story and, if applicable, explain why the like it.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Go around the room and hear from each of the other learners.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Have a brief discussion about 
    what all the resources had in common, where people’quot;s opinions diverged, 
    and how learning about these might impact the work learners do in the 
    Circle going forward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (60 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Try to engage a bit less during the coursework this week - do you 
    think the Learning Circle could continue next week if you weren’quot;t here?</p>

    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 5 - Failing is learning</h2>


    <p class="bold">This week focuses on helping learners to see failure and
     mistakes as helpful and necessary components of learning, instead of 
    something to be avoided. This activity also gets learners to reflect a 
    bit on the progress they’quot;ve made in anticipation of the final Circle 
    next week.</p>

    <h6><span>Check-in (10 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>Recap last week’quot;s plus/delta
    Stand-up: what I worked on last week, what I am working on this week, and what I’quot;ll need help on.
    </li></ul>

    <h6><span>Activity (15 min)</span></h6>
    <p class="list-below">Sharing some of the mistakes and struggles with 
    the coursework from the past weeks should help learners feel less 
    pressure about always “knowing” the right answer and allow them to feel 
    more comfortable asking peers for help.</p>

    <ul class="list-below">
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Prompt learners for a discussion about failure by reading the following:
    </li></ul>
    <ul class="sublist green">
    <li>This week we are going to talk about some failures we’quot;ve had so far.
     In Learning Circles, failure is not bad; in fact, it is a guaranteed 
    and inevitable part of learning. Just like toddlers fall when learning 
    to walk, we will all experience failure as we grow as learners 
    throughout our lives. If we really try to understand what we get wrong 
    and overcome our failure, we can learn even more from our mistakes than 
    from our successes.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul> 
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Ask learners to take a couple of 
    minutes to think about an example of a struggle or failure that they’quot;ve 
    come up against in the Learning Circle, what lesson they learned from 
    that experience, and how they can imagine using that lesson going 
    forward.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Go around the room, sharing 
    challenges and lessons learned. Try to focus less on the failure itself,
     and more on what was learned in overcoming it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (60 min)</span></h6>
    <ul>
    <li>If some learners seemed like they hadn’quot;t resolved the failures they 
    mentioned in the activity, see if another learner who knows the material
     is willing to help them out.</li>
    <li>Encourage learners to take some time reflecting on how much work 
    they have left in the course and if they anticipate questions or 
    challenges that they might want to bring up before the final Learning 
    Circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Plus/delta (5 min)</span></h6>
    <p>Ask learners to share one thing that went well for them today, and one thing that they would like to change for next week.</p> 

    <h6><span>Feedback (afterwards)</span></h6>  
    <p>Send summary to all the learners including a quick summary of the 
    session, the plus/delta feedback, and anything else you want the 
    learners to remember for next week.</p>



    <h2 class="green-heading">Week 6 - Wrapping up</h2>

    <p class="bold">The final week focuses on making a final push towards 
    learners’quot; goals and discussing ways in which they can continue with the 
    course materials. If your Learning Circle is longer than 6 weeks, you 
    can keep using the same format as prior weeks (repeating or creating new
     activities) and save this card for the final week.</p>

    <h6><span>Check-in (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <ul>
    <li>Recap last week’quot;s plus/delta</li>
    <li>Stand-up: what I worked on last week, what I am working on this week, and what I’quot;ll need help on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Coursework (50 min)</span></h6> 

    <h6 class="space-top"><span>Activity (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <p class="list-below">When you reach a good stopping point, convene in a circle to share your work and debrief about the experience.</p>
    <ul> 
    <li><span class="bold">First</span>: Go around the room and share a 
    victory they’quot;ve achieved. This could be by showing an example of their 
    work or sharing an anecdote.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Next</span>: Ask learners if there is anything 
    they’quot;d like to keep learning now that the Learning Circle is over. It 
    could be to continue with coursework they didn’quot;t finish, sign up for a 
    new course in a different subject, or a personal goal like explore new 
    job opportunities in the field.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Finally</span>: Brainstorm ways to help learners 
    find ways to reach their goals, by continuing to meet with each other, 
    finding new resources, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6><span>Survey (10 min)</span></h6> 
    <p>If you find it beneficial, distribute the learner survey included in 
    the facilitator handbook. This will give you some good feedback on the 
    learner’quot;s experiences and prime them for an engaging plus/delta.

    </p><h6><span>Plus/delta (5 min)</span></h6> 
    <p>This week is meta - ask learners to share one thing that went well 
    for them over the past 6 weeks, and one thing that they would like to 
    change for the next iteration of Learning Circles.</p>

    <h6><span>Certificates (5 min)</span></h6> 
    <p>Hand out certificates to participants who finished the online course and/or attended 5 of the 6 sessions.</p>

    <h6><span>Feedback (afterwards)</span></h6> 
    <p>Send summary to all the learners including a quick summary of the 
    session summarizing the experience and encouraging them to keep learning
     together. We’quot;d really appreciate you forwarding this, and any 
    additional feedback you have, over to us by emailing thepeople@p2pu.org.
     This will greatly help us improve Learning Circles going forward.</p>

    <p class="bold green">Thank you for all the work you put into this Learning Circle, we hope you’quot;ll do it again!</p>
