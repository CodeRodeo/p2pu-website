    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners 
    who want to take freely available online courses together, in-person. We
     believe that anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to 
    run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an 
    urban library system, this guide is here to help you get going.</p> 
    <p>You can run a Learning Circle with just this guide and an online course, but we highly recommend you create your Learning Circle using our free software tools. Our web app will generate a Learning Circle website where learners can signup and create a facilitator dashboard, where you can communicate directly with learners, set up automatic reminders to go out before each Learning Circle, and share weekly feedback with learners, P2PU, and other facilitators. </p>

    <p class="space-top">This handbook was developed by <span class="bold">Peer 2 Peer University</span> and <span class="bold">Chicago Public Library</span>, with support from the <span class="bold">Knight Foundation News Challenge</span>
     and a great deal of help from Anna Häggman and Katherine McConachie. We
     are grateful to everyone who contributed to the underlying thinking and
     structure of Learning Circles, especially the librarians and patrons in
     Chicago who pioneered this work with us in 2015.</p>
