    <p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners 
    who want to take freely available online courses together, in-person. We
     believe that anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to 
    run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an 
    urban library system, this guide is here to help you get going.</p> 
    <p>The first part - <span class="bold">Background</span> - provides 
    introductory information about Learning Circles and the type of learning
     that the format aims to develop. The second part - <span class="bold">Getting Started</span> - includes the steps you need to check off before beginning. The third part - <span class="bold">Running a Learning Circle</span> - introduces facilitation tips and the guidelines for the routine you’quot;ll develop each week. The final part - <span class="bold">Appendix</span> - includes additional tools and templates to make your Learning Circle as good as it can be.</p>

    <h4 class="green space-top" style="font-size:30px">A few things before we get started</h4>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Use our tools</span>. You can run a Learning 
    Circle with just this guide and an online course, but our open source 
    facilitator dashboard will help you promote your Learning Circle, manage
     sign ups, communicate with learners, and share feedback on a weekly 
    basis. Throughout this guide, you’quot;ll see teal highlights where the 
    software can support your Learning Circle. To get your own facilitator 
    dashboard, you just need to sign up at <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/" target="_blank">p2pu.org/facilitate</a>. It’quot;s free for everyone.</p>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Let us help</span>. P2PU can consult 
    individuals and organizations looking to get started with Learning 
    Circles. Our services include facilitator training workshops, course 
    selection and adaption expertise, ongoing facilitator support, web 
    hosting, and software tool integration. We are happy to have a 15 minute
     call with you to talk about strategy and answer any questions you might
     have - email <a href="mailto:thepeople%40p2pu.org?subject=Learning%20Circles">thepeople@p2pu.org</a> to get that set up.</p>
    <p><span class="bold caps">Share your stories</span>. We rely on input 
    and participation from the community, and your feedback will make 
    Learning Circles even better going forward. Head over to <a href="http://community.p2pu.org/">community.p2pu.org</a> to share feedback, photos, suggestions, and questions with facilitators from around the world.</p>

    <p class="space-top">This handbook was developed by <span class="bold">Peer 2 Peer University</span> and <span class="bold">Chicago Public Library</span>, with support from the <span class="bold">Knight Foundation News Challenge</span>
     and a great deal of help from Anna Häggman and Katherine McConachie. We
     are grateful to everyone who contributed to the underlying thinking and
     structure of Learning Circles, especially the librarians and patrons in
     Chicago who pioneered this work with us in 2015.</p>
